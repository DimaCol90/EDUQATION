>  * Researcher

>  * Designer
>  * Engineer
>  * Tester
>  * Shrink 


> As somenone ones said: "It's not enough to make it pretty, i has to be functional"

### Here is a list of recomended key points to be trained, in order to become a succesfull UX/UI Designer

* You should pick some of the list, depending on which direction you want to develop your skillset to:

<details>
<summary>1. Understand the process of UX/UI development</summary>

      1. Understand (be aware of the context you must design in)
      2. Research (ask, check for statistics, find common oppinions on the subject, understand your client)
      3. Gather ideas (internet surfing is the best way, especially now 2019+ when Google excels in AI)
      4. Sketch (Try to draw some simple solutions in wireframe, no details, just the main concepts)
      5. Design (Bring colors, forms, details, fonts, everything into the wireframe)
      6. Implement (Start transforming the design into the real thing (lyaouting, coding, prototyping))
      7. Evaluate (Test, Observe how other colleagues react to your product, test it on the client, test it on the third party)

<summary>2. Know the basics of GRAPHIC design</summary>
      
      * For each of the next "rules", try to learn at least several techniques to use them in your design (e. g. Hierarchy - can be achieved in typography by contrasting Font sizes, Font weights, proximity, etc...)

      1. Focus
      2. Hierarchy
      3. Direction
      4. Balance
      5. Repetition
      6. Continuity
      7. Symmerty
      8. Asymmetry
      9. Spacing
      10. Alignment

<summary>3. Know your tools</summary>
      * You will usually find people arguing "what is the best tool". The best tool is the one that fits your way of doing things the best. Choose wiselly.

   
      1. Pencil - Paper (the best tool :) )
      2. Sketch, Figma, Adobe xd, Flow (These are usually subscription, or registration based, some - paid solutions, but the advantage is you can accelerate your work)
      3. Photoshop, Corel, Illustrator (Nowadays these tools are less usefull for web development, but still, as a designer - it's an advantage to know one of them at least)
      4. Code HTML,CSS(SCSS),JS (Even if you are a web designer, having some coding skills not only increases the chances of getting a job, but helps you better understand what will be going on under the hood of your UI)
      5. Emulators (There are plenty of mobile/desktop devices emulators on the market (even in Chrome developer panel), using them will help you understand how your UI will behave in different environments (starting with screen size, orientation, networking speed,...))

<summary>4. Train your Skillset</summary>

      1. Creativity (you can train it by: combining logic with emotional intellect, developing a desire for knoledge, try and explain things - both emotionally and logically, let imagination run wild)
      2. Scoping (While viewing things in the real world - try switching between "birds view" and "detailed inspection")
      3. Attention to details (to train this try to limit the flow of information from time to time, try meditation, teach yourself to organize things, make lists, establish priorities)
      4. Brainstorm (Train yourself to sometimes get and idea of a new work with limited resources - in short period of time, without any clues, etc...)
      5. Connect the dots (The best way to train skill is to start small - designing on thing try to make small adjustments, then go for the "mission impossible" - tro to combine a few ideas that apparentelly do no fit in the same design)
      6. Immagination (To train this skill people usually recommend to traing visual memory - visualising things recently seen with closed eyes, trying to "virtually travel", actually gaming, 3D scenes in cinema, traveling can really bring a great impact into this)

<summary>5. Be aware of Technologies</summary>

      * You can have skills, but don't let your guard down and   "stay on the wave" of fastly evolving technologies. 

      1. Graphics:
         1. Vector
         2. Raster
         3. 3D
      2. Coding:
         1. HTML
         2. CSS
         3. SCSS
         4. JS
      3. Using version control:
         1. Git
         2. Svn
      4. Work in task centric environments:
         1. Redmine
         2. Coworking virtual software
      5. Colors:
         1. Color spaces
         2. Color profiles
      6. Frontend testing (web)
         1. Optimization fitness (https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)  
         2.

<summary>6. Know your Mission</summary>

      * To better understand your role into UX/UI, you must first understand your mission.

      1. Understand the user needs (The user is the one visiting or using the application or website you design, don't forget that!)
      2. Be in foot with the trends (Designers tend to think that thw whole world should consider theyre ideas pure "genious". Don't forget that the world is often about "trends")
      3. Think usable (A good UX/UI designer prioritizes Usability over Beauty)
      4. Transpose the clients desire into the users field of view (The hardest part of the mission as a designer is to "fit" the idea that your client has about the product to the "view" the public has about it)

* There are plenty of resources for learning web design / UX / UI design on the internet, but what I find to be the best for me is the Google approach, due to theyre long term analytics of Human / Interface interaction and clean, simple and efficient guidelines:

1. Google Material Design (best open source design system ever)
